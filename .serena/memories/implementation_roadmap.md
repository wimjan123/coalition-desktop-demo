# Implementation Roadmap: COALITION UI Transformation

## Phase 1: Media Interview Character Creation System (Priority: Critical)

### 1.1 Replace Step 4 Sliders with Interview Flow
**Target**: `src/lib/components/CharacterCreation.svelte` lines 338-391

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Create new `MediaInterview.svelte` component
- Design interview dialogue tree with 8-12 political scenario questions
- Each question presents 3-4 response options that map to position values
- Questions cover key Dutch political issues: immigration, climate, housing, EU, economy
- Responses feel natural and consequential, not abstract sliders

**Technical Details**:
- Interview state management with question progression
- Response-to-position mapping algorithm
- Visual design: TV studio/interview setting metaphor
- Smooth transition animations between questions
- Final summary showing established political profile

**Integration Points**:
- Maintain existing `positions` array structure for game compatibility
- Preserve `completeCreation()` function signature
- Add interview completion validation

### 1.2 Consequence Foundation System
**Purpose**: Track position changes for flip-flop penalties

**New Components**:
- `PoliticalHistoryTracker` utility class
- Position change detection and scoring
- Public opinion impact calculations
- Media reaction generation system

## Phase 2: Campaign Dashboard Immersion (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Transform Administrative Interface to Politician Briefing
**Target**: `src/lib/components/CampaignDashboard.svelte`

**Design Vision**:
- Presidential briefing room aesthetic
- Information presented as advisor briefings, not spreadsheets
- Interactive elements feel like political decisions, not form controls
- Urgent notifications and crisis management feel authentic

**Key Changes**:
- Replace data tables with advisor cards and briefing memos
- Transform campaign actions into strategic political decisions
- Add immersive crisis response scenarios
- Implement realistic time pressure and decision consequences

### 2.2 Desktop Environment Integration
**Target**: Fix fullscreen persistence and window management

**Technical Fixes**:
- Debug fullscreen state persistence in desktop store
- Implement proper window state restoration
- Add keyboard shortcuts for politician workflow efficiency
- Optimize window sizing for campaign management workflow

## Phase 3: Visual Design System Unification (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 Consistent Political Simulation Aesthetic
- Develop cohesive color scheme reflecting Dutch political environment
- Typography system emphasizing authority and professionalism
- Icon system for political concepts and actions
- Animation patterns that enhance immersion without distraction

### 3.2 Responsive Design Optimization
- Ensure desktop-first design maintains quality on all screen sizes
- Optimize for politician workflow patterns and multitasking
- Balance information density with usability

## Phase 4: Consequence and Realism Systems (Priority: Medium)

### 4.1 Political Flip-Flop Penalties
- Implement position change tracking across campaign timeline
- Generate realistic media criticism for policy reversals
- Calculate public trust impact based on consistency
- Create voter segment reactions to position changes

### 4.2 Enhanced Difficulty and Realism
- More sophisticated AI opponent behavior
- Realistic budget constraints and spending consequences
- Media cycle simulation with unpredictable events
- Coalition negotiation complexity reflecting Dutch political reality

- Implement flip-flop penalty system
- Add media reaction generation

**Week 7**: Visual Design Integration
- Apply consistent design system
- Polish animations and transitions
- Optimize responsive behavior

## Success Metrics

1. **Player Immersion**: Player feels like politician, not assistant
2. **Consequential Decisions**: Choices feel meaningful and have lasting impact
3. **Realistic Difficulty**: Game provides appropriate challenge level
4. **Interface Intuitiveness**: UI guides natural political decision-making
5. **Technical Stability**: No persistence bugs or UX friction

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure existing save games continue working
- **Performance**: Monitor component rendering performance with complex dialogue trees
- **User Testing**: Validate politician experience vs administrative feel
- **Dutch Political Accuracy**: Ensure scenarios reflect realistic Dutch political landscape
