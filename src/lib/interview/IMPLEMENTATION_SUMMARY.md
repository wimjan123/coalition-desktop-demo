## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Modular Design Pattern
```
InterviewEngine (Orchestrator)
â”œâ”€â”€ InterviewerPersonality (Behavior)
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationFlow (Logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ QuestionArcFactory (Content)
â”œâ”€â”€ PerformanceAnalyzer (Scoring)
â””â”€â”€ AftermathGenerator (Results)
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Background-Specific Personalization**
   - Each background gets unique question arcs
   - Difficulty automatically scales based on controversy level
   - Interviewer adapts behavior to candidate background

2. **Dynamic Conversation Flow**

   - Follow-up questions based on response tone
   - Contradiction challenges for inconsistent answers

3. **Realistic Aftermath System**
   - Dutch media landscape simulation
   - Demographic-specific social media reactions
   - Coalition partner political responses
   - Measurable impact on approval ratings

4. **Performance-Driven Scoring**
   - Real-time consistency tracking
   - Confidence measurement through tone analysis
   - Authenticity detection (personal admissions vs corporate speak)
   - Engagement scoring based on response depth
